## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I enjoy working with Python, JavaScript, and Java, but I'm always eager to learn the right tool for the job. Since learning how to program in non-tech roles, I have always enjoyed making automations to help out with my team's tasks. Having already done projects using the MERN stack, my current focus is on developing a full-stack web app using the PERN tech stack.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently seeking an entry-level role in software development, software engineering, or web development. If you would like to discuss my qualifications further and explore how I can contribute to your team, then feel free to reach out!
